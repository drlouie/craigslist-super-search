# craigslist-super-search

Craigslist SuperSearch(CLSS) is a Craigslist multi-location and full-state search program written in Perl, tested on UNIX FreeBSD 8.2, FreeBSD 11, WAMP, LAMP and other UNIX and Linux servers, virtual, hosted, local and otherwise.

Created by Luis G. Rodriguez (louie - drlouie - doctorlouie - louierd), in 2010, it hasn't quite been updated much at all since it was originally written, however its been highly instrumental with my marketing and market research efforts. Furthermore, its quite the nifty tool for quickly searching large swaths of areas for specific tangible and intagible goods I'm seeking to acquire. Feel free to help build it into something much more effective and efficient. I've just gotten used to it as it sits, however I'd love to see it progress immensely, which is why its being relesed under the MIT License.
